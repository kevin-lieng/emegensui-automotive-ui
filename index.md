# EmergensUI Blog

#### Blog Entry #10 (October 29, 2019)

Demonstrated my breadboarded demo to Professor Kristian Medri; however, it seemed to not be reading correctly. SDA and SCL data transmission didn't seem to work correctly between the Arduino and my sensor. There may have to be a change in IDE or Development platform. However, gotta first recheck the addresses on the sensors to see where the SDA and SCL are reading from. 

Pictures of the breadboarded demo can be found below.
Codes can also be found in the current folder on github.

#### Blog Entry #9 (October 15, 2019)

Created the PCB board for the project, uploaded the schematics, breadboard design, and pcb design. I made some mistakes, during my PCB arrangement but received 
help from Professor Kristian Medri. I have made the corrections and reuploaded revised versions of each below section of my PCB and Breadboard design below.

We have also met with our colloborator Professor Dennis Kappen after our PCB check up. We have received some feedback and what he believes will help us during our future
software and hardware plans for the rest of the system.

#### Blog Entry #8 (October 8, 2019)

Confirmed purchases with the rest of the group, retrieving headers for the connections of Blue Pill and Sensors.

#### Blog Entry #7 (October 1, 2019)

Orders for the items included in the budget have been placed. Proof of purchases of those orders have been uploaded to github to be made for viewing. 

Links for the document have been included below.

#### Blog Entry #6 (September 24, 2019)

Previously discussed the budget with the group of EmergensUI and the different sensors that we're all going to use, made sure that each of our sensors correspond to our proposal properly. 

Current budget for my portion can be found here.

#### Blog Entry #5 (September 18, 2019)

Rediscussed the software project with Professor Austin Tian, confirmed that we're working on HUD2 (Driver Assist) and trying to improve the pre-existing one. Got verification from Austin Tian that our idea in including a medical information tab within the vehicle dashboard. 

#### Blog Entry #4 (September 17, 2019)

Discussed the project schedule with the group members and included several project notes to serveral tasks to indicate that they have been completed. Will update schedule as more tasks are completed.

Uploaded and handed in project schedule to Professor Kristian Medri. 
Uploaded copy can be found on GitHub.

#### Blog Entry #3 (September 10, 2019)
Uploaded and handed in the proposal of the hardware section of the EmergensUI to GitHub and to Professor Kristian Medri. 

Click [here for proposal](https://github.com/kevin-lieng/emegensui-automotive-ui/blob/master/documentation/ProposalContentStudentNameRev03.pdf). 

Also met up with Professor Dennis Kappen today for a further explanation of the specific scenario of the Vehicle Digital Dashboard. Discovered there were two separate versions of this. 

HUD1 - The augmented digital dashboard for augmented video/audio information for the partner within the Ambulance. Relays audio/video messages from the dispatcher to display augmented scenario and help within the HUD or this section of the dashboard.

HUD2 - The driver assist of the digital dashboard. Relays GPS and vehicle information to the driver to aid the driver en-route to the patient and back to the hospital. 

We've decided to work and try to improve the HUD2 portion of the digital dashboard and include some medical information for the driver to access and view to make good speed estimates when driving.

#### Blog Entry #2 (September 09, 2019)
After much discussion amongst the group members and retrieving more details of the project from Professor Austian Tian and Professor Kristian Medri throughout the weekend. The group has discussed the different sensors that we are capable of doing to recreate a digital dashboard that may be in working condition. After our many decisions we were all able to finish our proposal and push the changes onto our own repositories. 

#### Blog Entry #1 (September 05, 2019)

It was on this date that we joined up as a group and chose the automotive UI and digital dashboard. After making collaborating together, we each created our own repository.
