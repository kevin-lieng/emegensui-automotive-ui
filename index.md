Also met up with Professor Dennis Kappen today for a further explanation of the specific scenario of the Vehicle Digital Dashboard. Discovered there were two separate versions of this. 

HUD1 - The augmented digital dashboard for augmented video/audio information for the partner within the Ambulance. Relays audio/video messages from the dispatcher to display augmented scenario and help within the HUD or this section of the dashboard.

HUD2 - The driver assist of the digital dashboard. Relays GPS and vehicle information to the driver to aid the driver en-route to the patient and back to the hospital. 

We've decided to work and try to improve the HUD2 portion of the digital dashboard and include some medical information for the driver to access and view to make good speed estimates when driving.

After much discussion amongst the group members and retrieving more details of the project from Professor Austian Tian and Professor Kristian Medri throughout the weekend. The group has discussed the different sensors that we are capable of doing to recreate a digital dashboard that may be in working condition. After our many decisions we were all able to finish our proposal and push the changes onto our own repositories.
