## Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------
BerryIMU is a third-party made PCB board that has several sensors that can be used to retrieve data. IMU stands for Inertial Measurement Unit, these are the units that relate to the movement of something. Not only is this third-party sensor capable of reading movement, but it can also read temperature, pressure, and geographical location. However, this documentation will be discussing the 
usage of this sensor to retrieve the data of basic movement and direction. Within this repository, you will find the multiple files that are available to use alongside with the instructions given for public use. These files can aid in the installation of the hardware and the software needed for the basic functionality of retrieving intertial and directional data.

The cost of the product depends on what type of services are available to you as a student or individual. If there are services near you that offer fine 3D printing services and fine PCB services at no cost, you may ignore the optional costs of this project. The necessary components of this project are stated within the first image of this section. Due to the main sensor, BerryIMU, being made by a third-party in Australia. The shipping of this component may take longer than the others listed. Most of these components may ship to you at no cost due to the availability of them on Amazon. 

The minimum cost of the project can be $140.44; however, if third-party manufacturing and printing services are needed, the upper cost can be $206.97.
